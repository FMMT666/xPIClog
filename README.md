xPIClog
=======

A simple, but quite versatile and configurable, long-time 8 channel SD-card data logger.
Powered by a PIC18 and [SourceBoost][1] Compiler.

For hardware and more info, visit [www.askrprojects.net/hardware/xpiclog/index.html][2]

Unfortunately, all the source code files can not be put in a subdirectory.
This is a limitation of MPLab in conjunction with SourceBoost.
Doesn't feel right, but doesn't hurt either...
